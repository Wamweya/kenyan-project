      <h2>Poverty</h2>
      <p class="excerpt">Poverty is a multifaceted issue affecting millions worldwide. It is characterized by a lack of resources, including financial, educational, and social support.</p>
      <p class="full-text">Despite efforts to alleviate poverty, many individuals and families struggle to meet their basic needs, leading to cycles of disadvantage and inequality. Access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities are crucial in addressing this pervasive issue.</p>

      <h2>Floods</h2>
      <p class="excerpt">Floods are natural disasters that can cause extensive damage to communities and infrastructure.</p>
      <p class="full-text">Heavy rains and flooding continued to ravage parts of Central, Coastal, Southeastern, Northwestern, Western, and Northeastern Kenya, resulting in the deaths of at least 174 people since October, according to authorities. As of 18 December 2023, authorities reported that more than half a million people have been displaced due to flooding and heavy rains, while UNHCR reported that over 30,000 refugees have also been affected. Approximately 90 per cent of those impacted by the flooding reside in Mandera, Garissa, Tana River, Wajir, Isiolo, and Meru counties. Many of those affected have temporarily relocated to displacement sites after the Tana River and other seasonal rivers overflowed their banks. The number of people living in displacement sites remains dynamic as the situation continues to evolve. There are at least 180 makeshift displacement camps, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society, with 61 in Tana River County alone, while some people in Garissa, Mandera, and Wajir counties have started to return to their homes as the water levels have receded. There have been reports of waterborne diseases such as cholera and diarrhea in flood-affected areas with new cases of cholera reported in Tana River County in December. While needs remain, 463,000 people have been reached with some form of humanitarian assistance.</p>

      <h2>Food Insecurity</h2>
      <p class="excerpt">Food insecurity is a pressing global issue, affecting millions of individuals who lack consistent access to nutritious food. </p>
      <p class="full-text">A decade of rapid economic growth, the inclusion of food and nutrition security in the government’s ‘big four’ priorities, constitutional changes that devolve administrative responsibilities to county governments and the country’s openness to innovation offer opportunities for the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 2 on zero hunger and improved nutrition in Kenya. However, even though the country has recently acquired lower-middle-income status, the increased wealth has not benefited all Kenyans equally. Over one third of the population still lives under the international poverty line and social, economic and gender disparities remain.

        Access to adequate quantities of nutritious food remains a challenge for many, especially in arid and semi-arid regions which make up 80 percent of the country’s land area. Factors include rapid population growth – at a rate of 2.9 percent a year – climate change, stagnating agricultural production and inefficient food systems. Food insecure families typically live in rural areas, are poor and depend on daily agricultural labour for income. Families headed by women are more likely to be food insecure than those headed by men.

        Malnutrition remains unacceptably high, with 29 percent of children in rural areas and 20 percent of those living in cities stunted. Significant vitamin and mineral deficiencies are a severe public health problem and some 1.5 million people living with HIV have their nutrition status undermined by their condition.

        Agriculture remains the main economic driver but is very vulnerable to climate shocks. Unpredictable rainfall and recurring droughts contribute to the disruption of crops – 95 percent of which are rain-fed – and the erosion of soils. Inefficiencies in food systems –  the networks that are needed to produce and transform food, and ensure it reaches consumers – lead to high prices and insufficient market supplies, limiting the availability of, and access to, food.

        Kenya hosts 500,000 refugees, mainly in camps in remote, food-insecure counties. Unable to work or move freely, refugees are highly dependent on international assistance. Opportunities for fostering self-reliance are being promoted and may be expanded to larger refugee populations.

        The World Food Programme is accelerating its shift from the direct provision of food assistance and services in Kenya to the strengthening of national systems and capacities to deliver food and nutrition security.</p>

      <h2>Porching</h2>
      <p class="excerpt">Porching is a term used to describe the act of sitting on a porch, often associated with leisure and community engagement. </p>
      <p class="full-text">Poaching poses a grave threat to Kenya's wildlife, including iconic species like elephants and rhinos. Illegal hunting for ivory and bushmeat continues to endanger these animals.Kenya has lost more than half of its wildlife resources over the last three decades. Competing natural resource utilization, escalating human-wildlife conflicts, and systematic poaching of elephants and rhino and the subsequent trafficking of wildlife products, continues to be the major threats to Kenya's wildlife.</p>
